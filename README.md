# Pomodoro

This is a little app I made that helps me study. Written in Swift, the App's desgin is based off the Pomodoro Technique, a time managing technique that allows you to achieve peak productivity. 25 minutes on, and then 5 minutes off. This really helps my brain focus on my work becuase it lets me know that I have a short break coming up. Feel free to check it out!
